    <p id="blurb"> Now that you’ve successfully started marketing your product, this hopefully means you have orders to 
        fulfil. There are three main ways to get your product to your customer. As your business grows, consider 
        moving to the next style of fulfillment. Each fulfillment strategy is arguably better than the last, for both 
        yourself as well as your customer’s needs.
    </p>
    <h2>Dropshipping</h2>
    <img src=".//images/dropshipping.png" alt="cartoon man delivering packaging through a computer monitor" class="articleimage">
    <p id="content">
        This is how almost every ecommerce business begins. In the past five years, dropshipping has become an 
        incredibly popular way to make money online, due to its low risk, high reward nature. However, there are 
        plenty of downsides, which make this style of fulfillment not very sustainable over a long period of time. <br><br>

        The way dropshipping works is simple. When somebody purchases your product on your website, instead 
        of already having a supply of product in stock, you instead purchase that item from websites like AliExpress
        at a cheaper price and have them shipped directly to the customer. This way there’s no risk in inventory if 
        your product doesnt sell, and you only spend money once a purchase has been made. <br><br>

        It seems almost too good to be true, and that’s because it is. These websites typically ship from China, 
        which means incredibly slow shipping times. Customers will likely wait weeks for their products to arrive. 
        This means increased efforts in customer service, and a decrease in returning customers. Dealing with 
        hundreds of orders being dropshipped can quickly become a logistics nighmare, with dozens of emails 
        daily, and numerous missing packages. This can also lead to chargebacks with the customers bank, which 
        can cost your business hundreds of dollars. <br><br>

        Although its simple and carries almost no risk, it’s important to view dropshipping as only a way to test if 
        your product and business model is successful. Once you begin to receive orders, it’s time to move on to 
        the another method of fulfillment.

    <h2>Self-Fulfillment</h2>
    <img src=".//images/basement.jpg" alt="home basement filled with product boxes" class="articleimage">
    <p>
        Although this isn’t often talked about in the ecommerce space, fulfilling your orders yourself can be a great
        first step when moving away from dropshipping. Unlike dropshipping, there is more of a risk involved, and 
        this style of fulfillment will involve an initial investment. However, if you’ve mastered your business model 
        with dropshipping you shouldn’t be too worried. <br><br>

        The first step is finding a manufacturer to buy your product in bulk. There are many ways of going about 
        doing this, but the most popular service is Alibaba. Alibaba can connect you with thousands of Chinese 
        manufacturers who are able to manufacture your product. The most efficient way to find a manufacturer 
        is to use the Request For Quatation (RFQ) tool. RFQ allows you to simply upload of photo of your product 
        and answer a few simple questions and the manufacturers will reach out to you. You will likely receive 
        dozens of quotations, but you should try and narrow down your decision to 3-5 manufacturers. Order 
        some samples and select the best option based on budget, and the quality of the product. <br><br>

        Once your product arrives, you’re ready to start fulfillment. If you’re using Shopify to run your business, 
        they make self-fulfillment extremely simple, allowing you to purchase and print labels straight from the 
        website. You should invest in a good label printer as well as plenty of packaging and you will be ready to 
        go. Your customers will enjoy fast shipping times, and your business will be more legitimized. <br><br>

    <h2>Third Party Logistics (3PL)</h2>

    <p>
        This final solution allows your business to scale almost indefinitely and removes almost all responsibilities 
        of fulfillment. This solution is using third party logistics. There are dozens of different services that provide 
        third party logistics, but they allow follow the same principles. <br><br>

        Like self-fulfillment, you will need to make an initial investment of buying your products in bulk. You’ll 
        follow the same steps provided before only this time you will be shipping your products to a warehouse 
        rather than your personal address. <br><br>

        Here, the logistics company will connect to your Shopify dashboard, and when an order is placed, they will 
        pick and pack your order and have it shipped straight to your customer, all without you clicking a button. 
        There are additional costs to the solution such as storage space and a small fee for each order, but in the 
        grand scheme of things, these expenses are well worth it. <br><br>

        Using third party logistics allows you to focus on continuing to scale your business, while not worrying about
        shipping out orders. Most services will work with small brands getting only 5 orders a day up to big brands 
        getting hundreds or even thousands of orders. This means no matter what size your business is, 3PL can 
        work for you. <br><br>
