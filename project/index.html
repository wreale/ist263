        In the past decade, ecommerce has completely disrupted and transformed the retail industry. Hundreds of
        billions of dollars are spent online every year. From the outside, it may seem that only the largest brands 
        and companies can get a piece of this pie, however now it’s easier than ever to start and manage your own
        ecommerce business, all from your home. What <span id="content">may</span> start as a side hustle now, can easily turn into a full-
        time career. With little to no risk getting started, there’s no better time to start than now!
        Across this website, you will receive the most essential information I’ve picked up after over three years of 
        experience in the ecommerce industry, creating and managing numerous ecommerce brands.
        But before we get started… you need an idea!

            <p>
                A niche, or the target audience of your business is a very important step in deciding what kind of product 
                you’re going to sell. When choosing a niche, make sure the audience isn’t too small, but also make sure it’s
                something you’re knowledgeable about. This will make advertising and marketing much easier, as you will 
                know your audience and product well

            <p>
                Now that you’ve decided on your niche, start brainstorming product ideas that relate to your niche. A 
                great place to look for potential products is AliExpress. AliExpress has thousands of products to choose 
                from, and almost all will be easy to fulfill using any of fulfillment strategies provided on this website

            <p class="steptitle"><b>Create your website</b></p>
            <p>
                Finally, it’s time to create your website. There are numerous different ecommerce services, but the easily 
                the most popular service is Shopify. Shopify is perfect for businesses of any size and provides industry level
                tools and insights at an affordable price. When designing your website, you can get as detailed as possible 
                using HTML and CSS or use one of their free or paid templates if that isn’t your speed.
