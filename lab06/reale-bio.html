        <p>My name is Will Reale. I’m an Information Management and Technology major interested in ecommerce and data analytics. I’ve run multiple ecommerce businesses myself which have proved to be successful. I’m also interested in graphic design and look forward to applying that knowledge to web design. Outside of school, I live outside of Boston where I enjoy going hiking, watching shows like Breaking Bad, and spending time with friends and family. I drive my beloved 2007 Honda Accord which I had the honor of bringing with me to Syracuse this year. I’ve been wanting to properly learn web design for years now and look forward to everything this class has to offer.</p>
